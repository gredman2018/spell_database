    <li>focus your intentions. take a moment to determine what you wish to manifest.</li>
    <li>write your manifestation on your bay leaf.</li>
    <li>close your eyes while holding your leaf and visualize the energy in your body and the energy around you. hold your energy close, expand it and then cast it out into the universe. imagine your energy soaring out into the cosmos and  reuniting with the energy that is present in all life.</li>
